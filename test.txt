This is a little test to add a new file to a new branch.

Steps to get files into github:

1. Create a new branch
> git checkout -b <branch name>

2. Push the new branch to github
> git push origin <branch name>

3. Add a text file to the branch
> git add <filename>

3. Commit the file to the branch
> git commit -m "type something describing the commit"

4. Push your changes to github repository
> git push
